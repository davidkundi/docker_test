The forked repository : https://github.com/davidkundi/webapp \
Docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com

Requirements: 
- docker
- git
- python
- pip
- virtual box(not necessarily)

## I am using Ubuntu, you need a Linux distro or VirtualBox with a Linux distro image and create a virtual machine which you will work on.

Open a terminal and download the gitpull.sh script or clone the repository.
